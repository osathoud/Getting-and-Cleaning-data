This code book provides the reader with a description of:
- The origin of the data
- the variables in the run analysis
- the data set called Cleaned_data.txt
- all transformation performed 

The data was obtained from the following "data link": https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
The data set  is described in the following  link: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities(WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a 
smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration 
and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. 
The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the
training data and 30% the test data.
The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding 
windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion 
components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed 
to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features 
was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.
Check the README.txt file for further details about this dataset.
A video of the experiment including an example of the 6 recorded activities with one of the participants can be seen in the link below:

An updated version of this dataset can be found at the link following below:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Smartphone-Based+Recognition+of+Human+Activities+and+Postural+Transitions
This version provides the original raw inertial signals from the smartphone sensors, instead of the ones pre-processed into windows 
which were provided in version 1. This change was done in order to be able to make online tests with the raw data. Moreover, 
the activity labels were updated in order to include postural transitions that were not part of the previous version of the dataset.
